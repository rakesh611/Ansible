Letâ€™s create a real-world playbook that uses the service module to dynamically manage multiple critical services on multiple hosts, with reporting and auto-fix.

ðŸ”¹ How It Works

Gather service facts â†’ Gets current state of all services.

Install packages â†’ Makes sure required service packages exist.

Start & enable services â†’ Ensures each critical service is running and enabled.

Report status â†’ Uses debug to show current service state dynamically.

Record managed services â†’ Saves which services were acted upon in managed_services fact.

ðŸ”¹ Example Output
TASK [Report final service status] ***
ok: [web01] => (item=sshd) => {
    "msg": "Service sshd on web01 is now running"
}
ok: [web01] => (item=firewalld) => {
    "msg": "Service firewalld on web01 is now running"
}
ok: [web01] => (item=docker) => {
    "msg": "Service docker on web01 is now running"
}
ok: [web01] => (item=nginx) => {
    "msg": "Service nginx on web01 is now running"
}

TASK [Display managed services] ***
ok: [web01] => {
    "msg": "Managed services on web01: ['sshd', 'firewalld', 'docker', 'nginx']"
}


ðŸ”¹ Benefits

Dynamically handles multiple services across hosts.

Automatically fixes stopped/missing services.

Stores info for reporting or external integration (Slack, dashboards).

Works on RHEL/Debian/CentOS etc.
