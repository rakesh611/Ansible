ðŸ”¹ Example 1 â€“ Install a Single Package
- name: Install requests package
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Python requests library
      ansible.builtin.pip:
        name: requests
        state: present


âœ… Installs requests package using system Python.

ðŸ”¹ Example 2 â€“ Install Multiple Packages
- name: Install multiple Python packages
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Install Flask and Django
      ansible.builtin.pip:
        name:
          - Flask
          - Django
        state: latest


âœ… Ensures both packages are up-to-date.

ðŸ”¹ Example 3 â€“ Install from requirements.txt
- name: Install packages from requirements.txt
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Install all packages
      ansible.builtin.pip:
        requirements: /home/ansible/requirements.txt


âœ… Reads the file and installs all listed packages.

ðŸ”¹ Example 4 â€“ Install in Virtual Environment
- name: Install in virtualenv
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Install packages in virtual environment
      ansible.builtin.pip:
        name:
          - requests
          - boto3
        virtualenv: /home/ansible/myenv
        state: latest


âœ… Installs packages inside /home/ansible/myenv virtual environment.

ðŸ”¹ Real-World Use Cases

Python app deployment â†’ Ensure dependencies are installed on all servers.

CI/CD pipelines â†’ Automatically prepare environment with required Python libraries.

Data pipelines â†’ Install analytics libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy) before running scripts.

Virtual environment management â†’ Keep app dependencies isolated from system Python.
