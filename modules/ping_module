🔹 What is the ping module?

The ping module is a simple way to check connectivity between the Ansible control node and the managed host.

It:
✅ Verifies SSH connection.
✅ Checks if Python is installed and usable on the target host.
✅ Returns "pong" if successful.

⚠️ It does not ICMP ping like the Linux ping command. Instead, it’s an Ansible-level test.

🔹 Syntax
- name: Ping hosts
  ansible.builtin.ping:

🔹 Example 1 – Basic Ping
- name: Test connectivity with all hosts
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Ping all servers
      ansible.builtin.ping:


✅ If the connection works, output will be:

ok: [web01] => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}

🔹 Example 2 – Ping a Specific Host Group
- name: Ping only web servers
  hosts: webservers
  tasks:
    - name: Ping web servers
      ansible.builtin.ping:

🔹 Example 3 – Debug with Ping
- name: Debug ping result
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: Ping and show result
      ansible.builtin.ping:
      register: ping_result

    - name: Show ping output
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        var: ping_result


✅ This stores the result and shows more details.

🔹 When to Use

Before running playbooks on new hosts (sanity check).

In CI/CD pipelines to ensure inventory hosts are reachable.

As part of monitoring or troubleshooting automation.

👉 Pro Tip:
If ping fails with an error like “/usr/bin/python not found”, install Python on the host (or use raw module to bootstrap Python).
