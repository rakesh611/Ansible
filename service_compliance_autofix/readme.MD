service compliance playbook so that instead of just failing on non-compliance, 
it will auto-remediate by installing and starting services that are missing or stopped.
ðŸ”¹ Explanation

Gather service facts â†’ Collects current states of all services.

Install missing packages â†’ Uses package module to ensure service packages are present.

Start & enable services â†’ Ensures each service is running and enabled at boot.

Report results â†’ Prints the final state after remediation.

Save compliance stats â†’ Saves list of services that were remediated.
ðŸ”¹ Example Run (Host Missing firewalld & docker)
TASK [Ensure critical packages are installed] ***
changed: [web01] => (item=firewalld)
changed: [web01] => (item=docker)
ok: [web01] => (item=sshd)

TASK [Ensure critical services are started and enabled] ***
changed: [web01] => (item=firewalld)
changed: [web01] => (item=docker)
ok: [web01] => (item=sshd)

TASK [Report compliance status after fixes] ***
ok: [web01] => (item=sshd) => {
    "msg": "Service sshd final state: running on web01"
}
ok: [web01] => (item=firewalld) => {
    "msg": "Service firewalld final state: running on web01"
}
ok: [web01] => (item=docker) => {
    "msg": "Service docker final state: running on web01"
}

âœ… Now instead of failing, it self-heals missing or stopped services.
âœ… Useful for automated hardening and self-healing infrastructure.
